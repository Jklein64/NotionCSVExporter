Attempt to Formulate Problem,💪 Confident,"July 26, 2021 10:25 PM","July 26, 2021",2.91 hour(s),2.91,175,"Researched the different types of optimization problems and found various slideshow presentations from a good majority of the colleges I was thinking of applying to (who knew that Wisconsin-Madison has Stephen J. Wright, an absolute powerhouse of a computer science professor?).

I then decided to try hacking on my definitions to the one that I found in the paper *An Improved Geometric Approach for Palette-based Image Decomposition and Recoloring*, replacing variable names, definitions, and explanations as I felt necessary.  I think it turned out quite nicely (and Yotam seems impressed!).

# Formulation

Our goal is to generate a polyhedron $\mathbf P$ that minimizes the following energy function $F(\mathbf P)$ where $REC(\cdot)$ is the reconstruction loss and $REP(\cdot)$ is the representative loss.  $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are parameters that control the contribution of each loss function to the energy function and the radius which selects neighboring points respectively.  The goal is to find the polyhedron that minimizes both of these losses as would be the most representative of the pixels in the image while also having the smallest reconstruction error.

$$\argmin_{\mathbf P} F(\mathbf P),\ F(\mathbf P) = \lambda \cdot REC(\mathbf P, \mathbf I) + REP(\mathbf V, \mathbf I, \mu)$$

The reconstruction loss $REC(\cdot)$ is a function of the polyhedron $\mathbf P$ and also $\mathbf I$, the set of all of the pixel values in the image.  $\mathbf i$ is an individual pixel in the image, and $\mathbf {i_p}$ is the closest point to $\mathbf i$ on the polyhedron if it is outside of the polyhedron, and is otherwise equivalent to $\mathbf i$.  The reconstruction loss is the average number of pixels that would not be recreated perfectly (meaning they lie outside $\mathbf P$) after decomposing the image $\mathbf I$ into the palette colors, weighed by the smallest distance of that pixel to $\mathbf P$.

$$REC(\mathbf P, \mathbf I) = \frac{1}{|{\mathbf I}|} \sum_{\mathbf i \in \mathbf I} || \mathbf i - \mathbf {i_p} ||$$

The representative loss $REP(\cdot)$ is a function of the color palette $\mathbf V$ (analogous to the set of vertices of the polyhedron $\mathbf P$) and also $\mathbf H$, the set of vertices of the convex hull of all of the points in $\mathbf I$ with no simplification.  Representative loss is the average distance between any given vertex of $\mathbf P$ and all of the vertices of $\mathbf H$ within a radius of size $\mu$ from the given vertex (if there are no vertices within this radius, then use the nearest vertex of $\mathbf H$ regardless of distance).  Due to the definition of a convex hull and the fact that $\mathbf P$ is a simplified form of $\mathbf H$, all of the vertices of $\mathbf P$ are initially guaranteed to not be within $\mathbf H$.

$$REP(\mathbf V, \mathbf H, \mu) =

\frac{1}{|\mathbf V|}

\sum_{\mathbf v \in \mathbf V}

  \Bigg\lvert \Bigg\lvert 

  \mathbf v -

  \frac 1 {|\mathbf{N_{\mathbf v}}|}

  \sum_{\mathbf n \in     
  \mathbf{N_{\mathbf v}}}

    \mathbf n

  \Bigg\rvert \Bigg\rvert$$

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{where}\ 

\mathbf N_{\mathbf v} &= \{ 
  \mathbf h 
  \mid
  \mathbf h \in \mathbf H
  \text{ and }
  ||\mathbf v - \mathbf h|| \le\mu
\}

\\
&= \{
 \argmin_{\mathbf h}
 ||\mathbf v - \mathbf h||
\}

\ \text{if $\mathbf N_{\mathbf v}$ would be empty}

Explain my idea,🤞 Mostly guessing,"July 25, 2021 6:25 PM","July 25, 2021",1.66 hour(s),1.66,100,"Spent a long time trying to figure out how to load the `fastLayerDecomposition` server again, since I wanted to get an example to help explain what my algorithm would do.  I had saved the code (and ran it through `autopep8` for formatting) so that I could read through it and try to find and intercept where the hull was being simplified (see yesterday's or the day before's notes).  It turns out that saving it for some reason led to weird python module import issues.  I wish python modules were like lua's `require()`, which literally just runs the file.

---

Once I got the `fastLayerDecomposition` demo up and running, I uploaded `turquoise.png` and took screenshots of the simplified convex hull and image decomposition before and after moving the blue vertex closer to the points, and then annotated them (see below).

> [Me] I guess this is similar to moving toward neighboring points, except we don't have to calculate nearly as many times (or estimate the points by taking a random selection like I think *An Improved Geometric Approach for Palette-based Image Decomposition and Recoloring* did) since $N$ for neighbors would be the vertices of the convex hull instead of every single point. We could also try simplifying the original hull, but just not as much as the one that we're trying to correct.

> [Yotam] If you can express your desire as a continuous function, we can run a numerical continuous optimization algorithm on it (even something as simple as gradient descent). It should continuously deform the vertices of a polyhedron."
Read some sample abstracts,🤔 Pretty Sure,"July 25, 2021 2:11 AM","July 24, 2021",0.41 hour(s),0.41,25,"Read some sample abstracts, including a whole webpage's worth of samples that were submitted to talks or similar.

In general, I think I have a feel for how computer science abstracts look.  The thing that's preventing me from completing my own is that I don't have any work to show for all of my research.  There is no solution, there is no proposal or data or way to prove that I have iterated upon the state of the art.  oof"
Read Through Yotam's Code,🤔 Pretty Sure,"July 24, 2021 4:52 AM","July 23, 2021",1.5 hour(s),1.5,90,"Read through the code in the `fastLayerDecomposition` repository which contains the client and server that actually runs the code from the paper.  The code is extremely extensive (especially the threejs part, which for some reason was shoved into a >1000-line file).

I was looking through the code to see if there was an easy point to insert my theory of an optimization algorithm.  I read through the areas that handled the points, hull, and palette, including the callbacks in the server and the 60-bajillion helper methods in the js file (thank god for VSCode's `peek > References` feature), but didn't see an easy place to put it.

I think the best idea would be to implement my algorithm in my own server.  Just make the lines thicker and have some way to differentiate between the simplified and unsimplified hulls (as well as a way to simplify them... maybe steal that from `fastLayerDecomposition`?).

## My Algorithm

> What if we used the unsimplified convex hull as a sort of target for the simplified one? Starting with the vertex of the simplified hull that is farthest from the unsimplified one and repeating, shift the vertex closer to the closest match to a corresponding vertex of the unsimplified hull (or farther away if needed for the optimization problem, which I realize is why that paper went from [-.5, 1]) but in a way that ensures the simplified hull is only excluding some 𝜖 points at most. Isn't a simplified polyhedron that resembles the unsimplified hull better than a simplification that is still a convex hull but isn't as tightly fit to the original data?

### TODO

- [ ]  Formulate as a formal optimization problem (what is an ""optimization problem""?)
- [ ]  Write the code to calculate the convex hulls (maybe do everything in threejs, since `[new THREE.ConvexHull().setFromPoints()](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=half#examples/en/math/convexhull/ConvexHull.setFromPoints)` looks like it might actually work pretty well)
    - threejs does weird things with half-edges instead of letting faces be defined by `points[hull.simplices]` though...
- [ ]  Write the code to run the optimization algorithm.  Maybe take inspiration from the first paper Yotam had me read (*An Improved Geometric Approach for Palette-based Image Decomposition and Recoloring*)?
- [ ]  Optional: create a screenshot feature and then save a screenshot every step or so and then reconstruct them into a video."
Color Upload and Selection,🤔 Pretty Sure,"July 22, 2021 5:57 AM","July 21, 2021",9.25 hour(s),9.25,555,"Spent more time putting the renderer together with a python script.  Modified the script to calculate the k-means with respect to r, g, b, x, and y, and then send the centroids over to the server.  Created an API for changing the color of the point cloud without affecting the actual positions, and also created a selection type called ""same color"" which will make a selection as usual and then add all of the points that share a color with any of the points in the selection.  This works really well when combined with the ability to upload points, as clusters from the k-means can be uploaded as colors."
Lasso Selection and New Idea,💪 Confident,"July 21, 2021 1:34 AM","July 20, 2021",4.16 hour(s),4.16,250,"I spent the time working on the renderer again whoops.  And I didn't even get the points thing working yet.  That's for the next time I did get back in.  I did, however, make it much easier to select points by switching from a box selection to a lasso selection.  In order to get the lasso selection to work, I needed to learn about point-in-polygon algorithms and winding numbers.  The idea behind the algorithm I ended up using is this: 

> let $\vec a$ and $\vec b$ be consecutive vertices of polygon $P$ (the lasso), point $\vec p$ be the query point, and $included$ be whether or not $\vec p$ is inside of $P$.  For every possible pair of $\vec a$ and $\vec b$, if $\vec {p_y}$ lies within $\vec {a_y}$ and $\vec {b_y}$ and $\vec p$ is to the left when looking at $\vec b$ from $\vec a$, then invert $included$.  The final value of $included$ is whether or not $\vec p$ is inside of $P$.

---

I also made an interesting observation.  As I didn't have easy access to the original image, I took a screenshot of a small thumbnail of one of the images used in the RGBXY decomposition paper.  When I put it into the renderer, I noticed that there were parts of the image that were more sparse (less dense) relative to the main clumps.  Selecting these (which was only possible with the new lasso and selection mode tools) revealed that they were generally pretty insignificant.

![Lasso%20Selection%20and%20New%20Idea%20f88a3c196d2f40d49487d9dbdbe387be/Screen_Shot_2021-07-20_at_4.54.26_PM.png](Lasso%20Selection%20and%20New%20Idea%20f88a3c196d2f40d49487d9dbdbe387be/Screen_Shot_2021-07-20_at_4.54.26_PM.png)

There's a pretty significant sparse area slightly down and left of pure white.

![Lasso%20Selection%20and%20New%20Idea%20f88a3c196d2f40d49487d9dbdbe387be/thoughts.png](Lasso%20Selection%20and%20New%20Idea%20f88a3c196d2f40d49487d9dbdbe387be/thoughts.png)

The green is what was selected, represented in both the point cloud and in the image (I actually like this view for the image; maybe I should switch it to default to the inverted color instead of white...).  Despite the large area that the selection appears to cover, the pixels the selection represents are scant and generally insignificant.  This strategy could be used to attempt to remove artifacts from images, and the density might be a good estimate of importance relative to the image."
Next Steps,🤔 Pretty Sure,"July 20, 2021 6:45 AM","July 19, 2021",3.83 hour(s),3.83,230,"Got started writing some python again.  Working with numpy arrays isn't that scary as long as I write a comment whenever an array changes shape (and also comments describing the shapes of parameters and the like).  At first, I tried to replace the k-means clustering with delaunay tessellation, but that wasn't working.  It was creating *more* clusters than there were points, so something was off (I asked Yotam if he knew).

---

Generalized the server post request code so it will accept a post request to `/:endpoint` and send `endpoint` as the `type` in the Server Sent Event JSON object.  This is in anticipation of wanting to add a lot more endpoints as I see fit, such as for drawing meshes for convex hulls or plotting clusters with specific colors (I currently want to do the latter)."
Work on Renderer,💪 Confident,"July 19, 2021 1:12 AM","July 18, 2021",10 hour(s),10,600,"Wrapped up loose ends of the renderer, handle state properly, refactor, etc.  Enabled the ability to upload images (from base64, which you could get to programatically) and convex hulls from a jupyter notebook to be displayed in the renderer, so now I can ditch previewing things with slow and laggy matplotlib :)

---

Learned a lot about Server Sent Events, which are an overlay to the HTTP standard.  By flipping a couple of headers and never ending the request (and also using a special API on the frontend called `EventSource`), the client can always be up to date with the server without forcing the server to keep track of every single one of its connected clients manually.  It meant for a lot less code on my part, but wasn't nearly as popular in tutorials as websockets and didn't have any wrappers or similar."

Work On Visualization Tool,💪 Confident,"July 9, 2021 7:58 AM","July 8, 2021",11 hour(s),11,660,"Learned a significant portion of THREE.js, which is really powerful and for some reason feels a lot less painful than python-style libraries.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. It turns out that vector projection gets really messy when it's difficult to define coordinate systems on planes...

Worked for a while at the beginning trying to create a keyboard-controlled system, but that didn't work well because I had to rotate the points instead of the camera (the math was too complicated; I almost figured it out by using spherical coordinates but $\phi$ (phi) would only go from $[0, \pi)$ and I needed it to wrap around, which my head could not wrap around (bad pun).  Ended up using not `OrbitalController` but `TrackballControls` which let me rotate over the top.

Worked on the selection mechanism for *a long time*.  Projecting from signed screen space into 3D is difficult (even when the origins line up), but the most difficult part is figuring out which of the points are actually inside of the box.  I can draw a box (the selection box) on a plane normal to the camera's looking vector and then project all of the points to this plane, but I can't easily shift to analyzing the points/box in two dimensions, which would be *sooooo* much easier.  I'm currently trying with some weird `vector.project(camera)` trickery, but the closest I got was selecting portions that weren't remotely related for seemingly no reason.

Food for thought: you can also create a somewhat looser convex hull by punching out traces from each of the planes normal to each axis. 

We could treat three of the six faces of the RGB cube as our planes and then project the colors down onto each face, allowing for 2d manipulation. Then we could punch out each face’s traces that exclude the outliers to create another bounding 3D shape."

The hardest part to wrap my head around is that the vertices of the convex hull are only equivalent to the palette colors for a convex hull in three dimensions (RGB).  The 5D convex hull, which was generated to help avoid ""spatial coherence artifacts"" (using only RGB, it's possible that two neighboring pixels have coordinates in terms of different simplices and will have different weights, so will produce ""speckling"" during reconstruction), doesn't have any equivalents in this way.

It’s really math-heavy and has a lot of set algebra, which I never learned in school (but had slowly been building up on my own through exposure to algorithms in Wikipedia). Thankfully the article had a terminology section :) 

Wrapping my head around some of these definitions is a little tricky, but I’m getting there. Haven’t made it to the algorithm section yet; still working through the terms and general process.

Edit 1: just finished reading through the paper.  The ideas it had made sense, but wrapping my head around all the set stuff was a lot.  They ended up doing an optimization that tried to minimax a system, so their solution actually made a lot of sense to me (it's similar to alpha-beta pruning)."

Update Yotam,💪 Confident,"June 25, 2021 5:02 AM","June 24, 2021",2.83 hour(s),2.83,170,"Reread my annotations and tried to answer as many of the questions I asked as I could before asking Yotam.  I also looked a little bit deeper into the specifics of some of the vocabulary (notably the mean value coordinate system), and then got sidetracked by flipping through a Princeton CS lecture on splines.

Additionally, I came up with an interesting idea for reducing reconstruction error that I intend to pass by Yotam for feasability.  It involves projecting the barycentric or mean value coordinates into negatives to include points that lie outside of a polyhedron in RGB space and then finding offsets in the other coordinates that would have equivalent change as a negative color (ie negative grey would get farther from grey, approaching either white or black depending on the axis alignment).

[before mome ripped it](https://www.notion.so/before-mome-ripped-it-a6896a74637746e0b447c17fb9ba46ef)

Thanks for helping me get started!  I spent some time with the paper you suggested.  I skimmed through the whole thing and made it about halfway through annotating a printed copy.  Annotating (marking stuff up) helps me wrap my head around key concepts and definitions (such as what a ""simplex"" is and how it can be used to define points in space).  

I had a few jargon questions as I went along, but was able to work through most of them with some quick google searches.  For example, I learned what ""sparse"" means in a graphics context (turns out sparsity can be helpful since multiplication by zero is easy).  I also learned what a ""barycentric coordinate system"" is and why it (or at least one that uses weights like the proposed mean value coordinates) would be helpful in the decomposition of an image by color.  And I learned the difference between a polyhedron and a convex hull (the latter is a subset of the former).  So, if it sounds like I have this reasonably straight, I think I'm mostly good for now on jargon. 

As for the concepts, I think I have been able to follow them well so far (though I haven't dug in on the math-heavy section yet).  I think that the main idea of their proposal is this: the polyhedron used to determine the weights and the color palette should try to *both* enclose as many colors as possible *and* keep its vertices as close to colors present in the images as possible.  This second part is what differentiates the polyhedron from a convex hull and, in theory, should make for a more representative palette.  Additionally, by using mean value coordinates of degree equal to the number of vertices of the polyhedron (instead of degree 3 used in some other approaches, which is the same as a barycentric system), the polyhedron can be calculated much faster, as it doesn't need to generate and tesselate a lot of simplices.  Please let me know if it seems like I'm missing something here.

Now for some questions/ideas:

First, on page 3, the paper states: ""The ASAP approach is rather fast, however, since the generated layer opacities have only C0 continuity, it suffers from speckling artifacts.""  What does ""continuity"" mean in this context?  Is it referring to the continuity of a two variable function that takes (x, y) and outputs opacity (making a 3D surface)?  What role does continuity play in palette-based decomposition?

Second, while I was reading through the Wikipedia page for barycentric coordinates, I noticed that they can represent a point that lies *outside* of the bounding shape by making one or more of the weights negative.  Normally a point with a negative weight would be discarded since it can't be directly translated to RGB.  However, if another combination of the palette colors could be used to create a similar color using all positive weights instead of a mix of positive and negative weights, then could the point representing this similar color be used to help reduce the increase in reconstruction error introduced by the fact that some points are discarded?  Does this seem like an accurate and useful concept?  If so, are there any papers discussing this type of color conversion?  Or is there only one combination of the palette colors that can reasonably create any other color found in the image?"
Print More Papers,🤔 Pretty Sure,"June 24, 2021 10:59 PM","June 24, 2021",0.25 hour(s),0.25,15,Print out the two main papers that form the backbone of the one Yotam sent.  They are the RGB color decomposition papers that were co-authored by him.  I labeled them with the way they were cited in the first paper.
Read the Paper Yotam Sent,🤔 Pretty Sure,"June 24, 2021 8:39 PM","June 24, 2021",2.66 hour(s),2.66,160,"Read and annotated the paper Yotam told me to read.  Current task for the day.  Future step would probably be to print out his papers that were referenced in this one (done) and read them like this too, or at least try to wrap my head around the different color decomposition methods (ASAP RGB, RGBXY, etc).

After about 2.5 hours I am only halfway through the reading and annotating.  I have had to look up many terms and ideas on google and spent a good amount of time on Wikipedia (which is surprisingly helpful for math and computer science).  Currently, I'm taking a break as I transition from the intro/lit review to the meat of the paper where they drill down their proposed process."
